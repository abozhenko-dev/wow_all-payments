                            The Paybis affiliate program is one of the best high-paying referral programs in the
                            industry. Unlike most crypto affiliate programs, which follow a hierarchical referral
                            structure, Paybis offers a much higher commission to users who promote the platform’s
                            services to their audience. This makes our platform ideal for webmasters or influencers with
                            large and small communities alike.
