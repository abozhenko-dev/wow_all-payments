                            When it comes to fraud and chargebacks, credit cards offer the highest protection to
                            consumers. At most, a cardholder is onlyliable for USD 50 of an unauthorized
                            transaction. Some issuers provide zero liability cards, meaning the cardholder will be
                            reimbursed for the full amount of the fraudulent charge. With credit cardtransactions,
                            the consumer’s cash reserves are not affected. While the available credit for the card
                            may drop temporarily after the fraudulent purchase is made the cardholder is not
                            affected much by the unauthorized purchase.

                            Chargeback can be used in cases of goods not
                            arriving at all, goods that are damaged, goods that are different from the description
                            or where the merchant has ceased trading. There is a time limit on chargeback claims –
                            typically 120 days. The time at which this period of 120 days starts depends on the
                            specific circumstances but will usually begin from the day the consumer becomes aware of
                            a problem with the goods. Additionally, once a chargeback has been filed a refund should
                            be credited to the account immediately.

                            transaction. Some issuers provide zero liability cards, meaning the cardholder will be
                            reimbursed for the full amount of the fraudulent charge. With credit cardtransactions,
                            the consumer’s cash reserves are not affected. While the available credit for the card
                            may drop temporarily after the fraudulent purchase is made the cardholder is not

                            or where the merchant has ceased trading. There is a time limit on chargeback claims –
                            typically 120 days. The time at which this period of 120 days starts depends on the
                            specific circumstances but will usually begin from the day the consumer becomes aware of
                            a problem with the goods. Additionally, once a chargeback has been filed a refund should
                            be credited to the account immediately.

                            Credit cards are widely used internationally, and enjoy a status of being widely
                            accepted as common payment method for Ecommerce and POS. However, in Asia only 41% of
                            online transactions are completed with a credit card. In some European countries (the
                            Netherlands and Germany) alternative payment methods (online banking e-payments,
                            invoice) are the dominant payment methods for Ecommerce.
